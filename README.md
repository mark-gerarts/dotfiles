# Dotfiles setup

Dotfiles with included setup script. Usage:

```
cd $HOME \
  && git clone git@github.com-personal:mark-gerarts/dotfiles-ubuntu.git dotfiles \
  && cd dotfiles \
  && chmod +x setup.sh \
  && ./setup.sh
```

Still needs some work to install required packages as well (e.g. emacs, rg, ...)
